<h3>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</h3>
<p>
    In Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Sonic teams up with Tails and Knuckles to face a new threat:
    the return of Dr. Robotnik, who brings a powerful new ally—Shadow the Hedgehog. As the battle intensifies, 
    Sonic and his friends must confront Shadow’s mysterious past and stop Robotnik’s plan before it’s too late. 
    The movie blends high-speed action, humor, and emotional moments, continuing the adventure from the previous films in the series.

<h3>Harry Potter all 7 series</h3>
<p>
    Harry Potter is a fantasy series about a young boy who discovers he's a wizard on his 11th birthday. 
    He attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he makes close friends, uncovers hidden secrets, and 
    learns he's destined to face the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents. 
    Across seven books (and eight films), Harry grows up while battling magic, mystery, and the power of love and friendship.

<h3>Wish Dragon</h3>
<p>
    Wish Dragon is an animated film about a teenager named Din who discovers a magical teapot containing a wish-granting dragon named Long. 
    As Din tries to reconnect with his childhood friend Li Na, he learns that true friendship and love are more valuable than any material wish. 
    The film mixes humor, heart, and a modern twist on the classic genie-in-a-bottle story, set in contemporary Shanghai.
